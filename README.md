# Arda

Maps of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, using DEM (Digital Elevation Model) and place vectors.


## Goals

- Make colored elevation maps with hillshading and name vectors
- Use as detailed maps for D&D Adventures in Middle Earth games


## Todo

- Make name placement, size, and visibility similar to Tolkien's maps - eg ERIADOR as angled line, visibile only at largest scales
- Set name sizes in m? option is to use map units (which is meters)
- Add river sizes in meters and render widths accordingly
- Make map views for the Hobbit (overview, The Shire, Eriador, Misty Mountains, Mirkwood) - how do?
- Host on GitHub

- Merge with existing shapefile project
- Get access to 40k x 40k DEM (50m/px) version
- Explain QGIS and pull requests for shapefile data in readme
- Post to Outerra forum, Reddit and find people to collaborate on project - r/lotr, r/thehobbit, r/tolkienfans, r/gis, etc

- Make map views for The Lord of the Rings corresponding to travels
- Update/organize placenames - current shapefile includes mountains/regions but as points
- Switch easily between colorful and minimal color versions - how do?
- Render to tiles for Google Maps-like site, using Leaflet - try vector map tiles and mapboxGL? include search index
